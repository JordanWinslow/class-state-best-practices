#Class Component Asynchronous State Best Practices

THIS IS A DEMONSTRATION OF BEST PRACTICES FOR UPDATING STATE IN A CLASS COMPONENT WHEN THE STATE UPDATE RELIES ON THE PREVIOUS STATE.

SINCE STATE UPDATES ARE ASYNCHRONOUS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OUR STATE UPDATES AFTER WE PERFORM A CALCULATION THAT RELIED ON THE PREVIOUS STATE, GIVING US AN INCORRECT VALUE.

TO AVOID THIS, ANY TIME STATE VALUES ARE USED INSIDE A STATE UPDATE, WE USE A CALLBACK FUNCTION TO UPDATE THE STATE INSTEAD OF MANIPULATING THE STATE OBJECT DIRECTLY. 

EX: this.setState((previousState, previousProps)=>{STATE UPDATE HAPPENS HERE}, ()=>{THIS HAPPENS NEXT})
